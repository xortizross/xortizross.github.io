Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Xochitl (pronounced sÃ³-chill). I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Ecology and Evolutionary Biology department at UCLA in the [Blumstein Lab](https://blumsteinlab.eeb.ucla.edu). I am a behavioral ecologist studying the long-term consequences of early-life adversity in wild yellow-bellied marmots (check-out [my latest paper](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ele.14485)).

## ðŸš§ Work in progress, come back later! ðŸš§
