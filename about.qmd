Ph.D. candidate in the Ecology and Evolutionary Biology department at UCLA in the [Blumstein Lab](https://blumsteinlab.eeb.ucla.edu). I am studying the long-term consequences of early-life adversity in wild yellow-bellied marmots (check-out [my latest paper](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ele.14485)).

I got my B.A. in Human Ecology at the College of the Atlantic.
